Cephalobyte is sort of a double pun... I’ll explain.

The emblem represents an octopus (even though only 6 tentacles are visible) in pixel art.

Octopuses are part of the Cephalopod (head-foot) family, known for their problem solving capabilities and adaptivity.<br>
It’s incredible to think they’re even part of our world.

So you probably guessed by now that "Cephalobyte" is a pun on "Cephalopod" and "Byte", an essential unit in binary computers, usually containing 8 bits, which also happens to be the same amount of tentacles the octopus has.
